To play this game you must travel through the rooms and answer questions to earn points.

The goal is to reach the final room with at least 21 points.

You can only move to the next room once you attempt the question in the given room. You cannot move backwards.

There is 1 room dedicated to each of the following themes:

Math, English, Science, Religion, History

In a given room, you will choose to solve either an easy or hard multiple-choice question. The question will be displayed
after you have chosen a difficulty, and you cannot change it after you have chosen. The difficulty is chosen separately
for each room you enter, so choosing a hard question in one room does not force all following rooms to show hard questions.

Easy and hard questions have different value.
If you answer a question correctly, you gain the number of points corresponding to the value of the question. If you
answer incorrectly, you lose the number of points corresponding to the value.

The game is over when you reach the final room. If you have at least 21 points, you win! Otherwise, you lose!
